## Project Description

### This is a simple version of Tic Tac Toe designed in Java to demonstrate algorithmic understanding of the MiniMax Algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize the AI's moves given that the user is making the best moves for themselves.

## How to compile and run

### If using Visual Studio Code, ensure you have the Java Extension Pack downloaded. Make sure the "Game_Files" package contains the "Interfaces" package, Main.java, and SpotScore.java. The program can be run directly within the IDE after navigating to **File > Open Folder...** and choosing the folder containing these files. Have the Main class open in Visual Studio Code and click the **Run > Run Without Debugging** option.

### To run the file with no IDE on windows, open a command prompt. Navigate to the directory with the files using the command **cd [filepath]**. Enter the following two commands in succession **javac Main.java** and **java Main**.

### For other operating systems, look online for running java programs from the command prompt.
